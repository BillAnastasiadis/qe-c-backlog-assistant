            This table shows the balance between ticket creation and ticket resolution. 
            If more tickets arrive than we are capable of solving, 
            it means that the length of the backlog will grow, and therefore we need more work force in that project. 
            And more tickets come out than come in, so we can divert workforce to other projects if necessary.
            Two time ranges are contemplated, short-term (30 days) and medium-term (4 months)
